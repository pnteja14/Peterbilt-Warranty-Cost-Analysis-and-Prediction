Dataset Description:

The project uses two primary datasets provided by Peterbilt Motor Company:

    Attributes Dataset:
        Contains a list of 8 vehicle attributes for each truck, along with an assigned "Option Code" for each attribute, ranging from Option 1 to Option 315.
        Each attribute represents a specific vehicle component or specification chosen by the customer, reflecting the high customization of Peterbilt trucks.

    Warranty Claims Dataset:
        Records warranty claims data for the same set of trucks in the attributes dataset.
        Includes information on claim amounts, claim frequency, and possibly the type of issue, enabling analysis of the costs associated with each vehicleâ€™s configuration.

Together, these datasets support a multivariate analysis of the relationship between vehicle attributes (and their combinations) and warranty costs. This enables insights into which configurations are more likely to incur higher warranty expenses.
